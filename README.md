# AI Sudoku Solver with Computer Vision
Embark on a journey where artificial intelligence meets the classic game of Sudoku. This project presents an AI Sudoku Solver that leverages the power of computer vision to interpret and solve Sudoku puzzles from images. By integrating advanced image processing techniques with deep learning algorithms, this solver not only detects the puzzle from a given image but also fills in the correct numbers with impressive accuracy.

Key Features
Computer Vision: Utilizes state-of-the-art image recognition to accurately identify Sudoku grids and digits from various image sources.
Deep Learning: Employs neural networks to understand and solve complex Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
User Interface: Provides a simple and interactive platform for users to upload images of Sudoku puzzles and receive instant solutions.
Versatility: Capable of handling puzzles from printed media, digital screens, and handwritten inputs with high precision.

How It Works
Image Input: Users upload an image of a Sudoku puzzle to the platform.
Puzzle Detection: Computer vision algorithms process the image to detect the puzzle grid and the filled numbers.
Solving Algorithm: The AI employs a combination of techniques to fill in the missing numbers, ensuring every row, column, and subgrid follows Sudoku rules.
Solution Output: The completed puzzle is displayed, providing users with the correct solution.

Technologies Used
Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow
AI & Machine Learning: Custom neural network models
Frontend: React.js for a responsive web application
Backend: Python for robust server-side logic

This AI Sudoku Solver is not just a tool for puzzle enthusiasts but also serves as a showcase of the practical applications of AI and computer vision in recreational problem-solving.
